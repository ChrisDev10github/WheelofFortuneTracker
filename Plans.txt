Rules:
Round =word
For each person turn they can either buy vowel for $250, guess word, or (spin/guess letter)
If you guess a consonant wrong, guess vowel wrong, spin a bankrupt, or spin lose turn. You lose turn and go to next player
If you spin bankrupt you lose all money regardless of round. 
If they player guesses word consonant correctly the they are reprompted the same threee choices.
If the player spin/guess consonant correctly then decides to spin/guess again and get it wrong they still earn the money from the first spin/guess of that turn.
If the player wants to guess the word they don't gain any more money but the round finishes
2 rounds then final round
No phrases and just words
No categories
If there are 3 T's and they guess T they get triple the value
